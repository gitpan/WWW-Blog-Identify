WWW/Blog/Identify version 0.01
==============================

Weblogs are a common online format, but they're a pain to detect programatically.
Most common blog creation tools don't add a generator tag or other useful metadata,
so it's up to Perl to step into the breach.  

This module uses a suite of regular expressions to try and suss out whether a page is 
a blog, and if so, what kind of CMS it was created with.   The blog detection part
is pretty rudimentary (but effective) - if you have an RSS feed, or use the word
'blog' five times on your page, or match one of the engine-specific regexes in 
this module then you are marked as a blogger.   

The classification part relies on some common boilerplate found in many blog templates,
as well as those ubiquitous 'powered by' images, to determine the CMS used in creating
the page.   In order of preference, the module tests the URL, looks for META tags, and
then wades into the actual content.

Additions and improvements on this module are always welcome.  My preference is for
false negatives over false positives, so please keep that in mind when creating patches.

If you are a blog tool designer, please consider adding a distinctive comment or (better yet)
a META tag to your default template, to reduce the risk of not being counted.
